# product_email

This is a weekly product promotions email that would be sent out weekly to feature new deals and products. Strictly made with HTML and CSS, using nested tables.

The most challenging part for me was keeping track of the nested tables and the CSS that affected them, but I got around this using comments to help section out each table. In the end, I used the mailchimp CSS Inliner Tool to convert the CSS. I had to do a little fix here and there, but it came out working at the end. This email can be displayed on multiple devices and different screen sizes
