# product_email

This is a weekly product promtion email that would be sent out weekly to feature new deals and products. Strictley made with HTML and CSS, using nested tables.

The most changling part for me was keeping track of the nested tables and the css that effected them, but I got around this using comments to help section out each table. At the end I used mailchimp CSS Inliner Tool to convert the css. I had to do a little fix here and there, but it came out working at the end. This email can be displayed on mulitple devices and different screen sizes.
